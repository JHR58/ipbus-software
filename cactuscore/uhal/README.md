Documentation of the uHAL software repository

**End-users beware ...** this documentation contains all classes that form part of uHAL, but you will only need to use the following classes (each class name is a link to the Doxygen page for that class):

* `uhal::ConnectionManager`
* `uhal::HwInterface`
* `uhal::Node`
* ...

Before looking at these doxygen pages, please read the uHAL quick tutorial [here](https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/wiki/uhalQuickTutorial) for an overall summary of how to use uHAL and IPbus.
